As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly
Functional, deployed application.


User can search for weather reports by city using the openweathermap API.
After searching for a city, the following information is displayed:
Current temperature
Current humidity
Windspeed
Uv index
5 day forecast
Application uses icons to represent weather conditions.
Application stores previously searched for cities in localstorage and displays them to the user.
Application loads last searched city forecast on page load.
